## About me

I am a current PhD student in ecology with research interests covering soil-vegetation-climate interactions, hydroclimatic influences on carbon and nutrient cycling, and soil microbial community composition and the factors that influence it. My research approach is based on process, conceptual, and stochastic models of water, carbon, and nutrient fluxes, and I test these models using local and global datasets.
