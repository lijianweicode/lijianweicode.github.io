## About Me

Here is **Jianwei Li (李健炜)**.

My academic journey has been driven by a profound passion for environmental science and ecology. I completed my undergraduate studies in Environmental Science, followed by my decision to pursue a Master's degree in Ecology. Subsequently, I embarked on a continuous academic journey, seamlessly transitioning into a Ph.D. program, all within the realm of environmental ecology. Throughout my doctoral studies, I have remained dedicated to exploring the intricate relationship between **soil organic matter** and **soil microbial communities**. Here is [[my CV](https://lijianweicode.github.io/file/CV_Jianwei Li.pdf)].

## Research Interests

- Soil organic matter
- Soil microbial communities
- Applied Machine Learning

During my pursuit of a Ph.D. degree, I employed high-throughput sequencing technology, fluorescence spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy to investigate the impact of varying qualities of organic matter on soil microbial diversity and the influence of soil microbial survival strategies on organic matter decomposition under wetland ecosystem succession conditions. Furthermore, I have had the privilege of disseminating my findings through several scholarly publications. Most recently, my research interests have revolved around the complexities and diversities of soil organic matter in forested wetlands and their role in driving the community structure of soil microorganisms under the influence of climate change. I am also conducting a global-scale meta-analysis to examine how anthropogenic disturbances impact soil microbial diversity in wetland ecosystems.
