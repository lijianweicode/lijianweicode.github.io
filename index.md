## Jianwei Li

I am a researcher with a background in environmental science and ecology. I hold a Master's degree in Ecology and currently pursue a Ph.D. in the same field. My research primarily focuses on soil ecology and the biogeochemical cycles, with a specific emphasis on soil microbiology. My academic journey has been driven by a genuine passion for understanding and preserving our environment. Through my work, I aim to contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationships within ecosystems, particularly the role of soil microbes in maintaining environmental health. Here is [[my CV](https://lijianweicode.github.io/file/CV_Jianwei.pdf)].
